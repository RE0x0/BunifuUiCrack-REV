# BunifuUiCrack
Bunifu UI Cracked (First non-virus version lol...)<br>
You can use this with the 7.2.0 version of the Bunifu UI Library.<br>
(Or, you can use this with any version with Bunifu UI that **uses Bunifu.Licensing 6.0.4**)<br>
<br>
This only works for .NET Framework, i will work on a .NET Core crack soon.<br>
## How to install?
1. Go to your project's folder (On Windows: C:\Users\yourusername\source\repo\ProjectName)
2. Find the packages folder (If you cant find it go one folder down it should be in the solution's folder)
3. Find Bunifu.Licensing.6.0.4
4. Overwrite the file.
5. Done! Enjoy
